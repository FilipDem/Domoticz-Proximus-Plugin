# Domoticz-Proximus-Meter
Plugin for the support of the Proximus meter (internet consumption - also known as Proximus) in Domoticz.
Only for Belgian Proximus customers!

The plugin creates a device with consumed bandwith registered by the Proximus provider. Follow the instructions in the Hardware tab to create credentials to get access to the used internet volume.

The plugin only works when there is only one Proximus subscription (one address). If you have a case with multiple subscriptions (eg internet on different addresses), you need one device per address. This is currently NOT supported. Add simply a request if required (not that difficult to support).
